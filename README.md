## procedural-caves
This project is the visualization of procedural cave generation. Very much a WIP

## Setting Up
You must have a python environment with [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/), [noise](https://github.com/caseman/noise), and the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) modules.r

This install line should do the trick: ```pip install pygame numpy noise```
